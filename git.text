Discovered that freeing memory occupied by leaf_list : TObjectList is cumbersome if allowed to grow "too large." The change to be made is to break the processing up so that the leaf_list will never have more than the permutation count of the length of the string input by the user. Previously, it was the sum of the permutation counts for the various lengths of the strings returned.

Can gather the raw words into a string like "raw","raw", ... to send to the words table in a simple query which return will be the legitimate words.

Currently, am attempting to get some internal messaging going in order to emulate Python's yield.
